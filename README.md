## Early intervention platform for potential high school dropouts

A platform that integrates a predictive model using machine learning to flag students at risk of dropping out of high school. Based on significant evidence supported by research, the model uses isolated inputs recognized as predictive markers for students dropping out and thus assigning a percentage of probability at which they are likely to drop out. More importantly, the platform provides a user-friendly interface that allows for the data to be easily visualized allowing for the school to identify students at risk of dropping out. The feature enables schools and parents to intervene prematurely to prevent such actions to occur.
